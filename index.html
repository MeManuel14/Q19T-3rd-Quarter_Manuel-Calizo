“This film truly captures something enduring about what it's like to be a kid, and it continues to speak to that child in all of us.”
<br><br>

2. Marylynn Uricchio
“Without being the least bit schmaltzy or cloying, Home Alone manages to impart the holiday spirit. Its saving grace is an unexpected vein of irreverent humor that verges on the black.”
<br><br>

3. Catherine Dunphy
“This is going to be a big hit with the kids. Word will get out in the schoolyard that Home Alone is really funny. Just don’t let the kids near the iron after they’ve seen it.”

Robert
This is one of the best animated super hero films I have seen. It is an excellent adaptation of the famous anime with a good story, and fantastic protagonists. Plus, it has the best anime trio ever!

Vague Visages
As long as there’s creative juice for this world, any follow-up would feel inspired. It’s a tough act to follow; it’s difficult to outshine one of the most multidimensional animation films of the decade.
<br><br>
Mike Massie
Gone With The Twins
It’s yet another example of a generic, forgettable superhero story catering almost exclusively to sci-fi action, entirely ignoring whether or not it feels coherent or meaningful.
<br><br>
Tina Kakadelis
Beyond the Cinerama Dome
Why the majority of superhero movies chose gloomy color palettes instead of Technicolor ones like Spider-Verse will never make sense. Ultimately, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a shining example of what a superhero movie can be.</td>
